# Mapping wind withh R

In this repo, I will show you how to make beautiful maps of wind streamlines with R. Wind streamlines are curves that show the direction and speed of the wind at different points on the Earth. They can help us understand the weather and climate better.

To make these maps, I will use data from the Climate Data Store, which is a service that gives us access to many kinds of climate data, including satellite observations. I will use the ERA5 reanalysis data set, which is one of the best data sets available for studying the atmosphere. I will also use `ecmwfr` package to download the data, `tidyverse` to process, and `ggplot` and `metR` to plot the data. R is a free and powerful software for doing statistics and graphics.
